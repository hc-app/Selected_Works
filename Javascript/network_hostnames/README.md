# Discover Network Hostnames and Files (Javascript)

A program using a game's API that discovers all the hostnames of servers on a network. It works under the assumption that the network is a graph where each node has a unique hostname. It starts at a node and then finds all of the adjacent nodes by scanning each node recursively until all of the hostnames have been found. 

It also create analytics such as: 
- Creates a table that shows the distance of each server from the starting node.  
- Discovers files on each of the server and creates a list of all the files on each of these servers.


## The project showcases the following technical features:

### Javascript:
- Use of functionalities and data accessible only through an API to a closed system's game instance
- Built from raw Javascript to showcase extend of Javascript knowledge and capability
