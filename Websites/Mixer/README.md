# Website: Audio Mapped to Keys (HTML5/CSS/Javascript)

The website contains a mixer that plays audio files that are mapped to certain keys. It also have options to change the volume or the sounds that are mapped to the keys. The website is made from HTML5, CSS, and raw Javascript.

## The project showcases the following features:

### Javascript:
- Key mapping to audio files hosted online using asynchronous calls
- Event-listeners that triggers on key presses (up and down)
- Functional programming reusing code to keep the project code simple - to understand and reduce project file size
- Debouncing key inputs on client side to reduce server calls also acting as a preventative measure against DDOS
- State changes tracked and stored locally e.g. updateAudio and updateDisplay
- CSS updated on event triggers
- CDN redundancy checks for valid CDN links prior to loading
- Built from raw Javascript to showcase extend of Javascript knowledge and capability

### HTML5:
- Logically structured div and sections
- Organized and labeled HTML elements
- CDN imports on header to create the perception of smoothly loading

### CSS:
- Variable media screen size for desktop and mobile usability
- Slider and button toggles
- Use of flex and grid displays
- Reusable CSS elements
